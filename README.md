## Install

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/path-simplify.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release.

## Tools

The following tools can be found under `Plugins > Path Tools`.

### Simplify Path

Reduces the number of points in a path using [Simplify.js](https://mourner.github.io/simplify-js/). Note that this tool will only work for paths with straight line segments.

### Snap Points to Pixels

Aligns points to their nearest pixel value. Unlike the built in "Round to Pixel" function, this tool works for both single paths and groups of paths.
